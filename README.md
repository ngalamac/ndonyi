# No Repeats Please

Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters. Assume that all characters in the provided string are each unique.

For example, `aab` should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations (`aab`, `aab`, `aba`, `aba`, `baa`, `baa`), but only 2 of them (`aba` and `aba`) don't have the same letter (in this case `a`) repeating.

Submit a pull request to the main branch with your solution. Do not modify the tests. Once you have created a PR with passing tests, then you have successfully completed the exercise.
